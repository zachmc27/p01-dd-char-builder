    <div class="species">
        <li><b>Elf</b> - Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of
            it. They live in places of ethereal beauty; in ancient forests or in silvery spires, where soft music drifts
            through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze.They love nature and magic, art and artistry, music
            and poetry, and the good things of the world.

        <li><b>Gnome</b> - A gnomes energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of their tiny body.
            Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and
            play.

        <li><b>Half-Orc</b> - Half-orcs are humanoids born of both human and orc ancestry. Though often shunned in both
            human and orcish society, though for different reasons, half-orcs have proven themselves from time to time
            as worthy heroes and dangerous villains.

        <li><b>Halfling</b> - Halflings are affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship
            as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. They love discovering new
            things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.

        <li><b>Human</b> - Humans are the youngest of the common races and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves,
            and dragons. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the different lands where they have
            settled. They live fully in the present, but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.

        <li><b>Dragonborn</b> - Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, they walk proudly through a world that greets
            them with fearful incomprehension. Dragonborns originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race. Some
            are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others
            find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

        <li><b>Tiefling</b>- Tieflings are humanoid creatures born from a mix of humanoid and infernal lineage. They’re
            devilish ancestry is visible in their features, most prominently known to be horns and tails. Often viewed
            with disgust by others, some tieflings live their lives in the shadows as criminals while others attempt to
            defy fate and become heroes.

        <li><b>Fey</b> - Usually humanoid in form, the Fey have supernatural abilities and a strong connection to
            nature. In addition to their magical lineage they are also known for their trickery and riddles. One must
            always be careful when making deals or pacts with them – you might find yourself on the upsetting (or
            dangerous) end of a practical joke.

        <li><b>Genasi</b> - With elemental blood flowing through their veins, Genasi are powerful beings with a divine
            connection to fire, water, earth or air. Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their
            unsettling appearance and strange magic while others gain positions of great influence, especially where
            elemental beings are revered.
