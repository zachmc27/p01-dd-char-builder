D&D Character Builder
by Group 11 - Daphne, Jahir, Olivia, Sam, and Zach

DESCRIPTION:
Our project is a Character Builder for a traditional Dungeons and Dragons game. We decided on this concept because we wanted to make something that would allow the user to be as creative as possible, yet still provide them with a clear and organized Character Sheet once they're finished. In order to accomplish that, our project allows them to walk step by step through choosing a name, species, class, and more. They can also "roll the dice" to get randomized stats for their character. At the end, they submit their character and receive a Character Sheet that they can use as a reference throughout their game, and which can be stored in a Gallery to return to at a later time.

TECHNOLOGIES:
To create this project we utilized the Bootstrap CSS framework. This is how we created elements such as the drop down menu on the details page.
